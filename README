egs is a library used to produce and render text templates that have embedded GorillaScript code in them.

A template may look like something like this:

  Dear <%= name %>,
  
  <%-- This is a comment, not rendered --%>
  We regret to inform you that your son or daughter, <%= child-name %>
  did not attend school today.
  
  <% if suspended: %>
  We have no choice but to suspend your child until further notice.
  <% end %>
  
        Sincerely,
        <%= administrator-name %>

Arbitrary code can be placed inside <% %> and text that is to be written inside <%= %>. These tokens can be customized.
